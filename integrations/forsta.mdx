## Single Followup Question

To add a single followup question for an open-end, follow these steps:

First, initialize the API request data in an `<exec>` block. This sets up the headers and prepares the request body:

```decipher
<exec>
# Set up API headers with your Aftercare API key
p.api_headers = {
    "X-Aftercare-Key": "<AFTERCARE API KEY>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Get the question and response from your survey
question = TopicQuestion.title  # replace with your topic question variable
response = TopicQuestion.val  # replace with your topic question variable

# Prepare the API request body
p.api_data = '{
    "question": "' + question + '",
    "answer": "' + response + '",
    "surveyName": "<Your Survey Name>",  # optional
    "surveyDescription": "<Description of your survey>",  # optional
    "questionContext": "<What you want to learn from the respondent>",  # optional
    "guidanceBehavior": "Succinct"  # optional, defaults to "Succinct"
}'
</exec>
```

Next, make the API request using the `<logic>` block. This sends the request to Aftercare's API and waits for the response:

```decipher
<logic
    label="followup_request"
    api:data="p.api_data"
    api:headers="p.api_headers"
    api:method="POST"
    api:url="https://surveys.getaftercare.com/api/v1/followups"
    sst="0"
    uses="api.1"
/>
```

After receiving the response, process it in another `<exec>` block. This handles both successful responses and errors:

```decipher
<exec>
# Check if the API call was successful
if followup_request.status == 200:
    # Extract the followup question from the response
    p.followup_question = followup_request.r["followupQuestion"]
else:
    # Use a fallback question if the API call fails
    p.followup_question = "Is there anything more you'd like to add?"
</exec>
```

Now, display the followup question to the respondent using a `<textarea>` element:

```decipher
<suspend />
<textarea
    label="FollowupQuestion"
    height="10"
    optional="0"
    width="50">
    <title>${p.followup_question}</title>
</textarea>
```

Finally, store the followup question in a variable for data export and reporting:

```decipher
<suspend />
<exec>FOLLOWUP_Q_TEXT.val = p.followup_question</exec>
<suspend />
<text
    label="FOLLOWUP_Q_TEXT"
    optional="0"
    size="25"
    where="execute,survey,report">
    <title>FOLLOWUP_Q_TEXT</title>
</text>
<suspend />
```

## Multiple Followup Questions

To implement multiple followup questions that continue until the AI determines no more questions are needed, follow these steps:

First, initialize the API request data and tracking variables. This sets up the headers and prepares the variables we'll need to track multiple followups:

```decipher
<exec>
# Set up API headers with your Aftercare API key
p.api_headers = {
    "X-Aftercare-Key": "<AFTERCARE API KEY>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Get the initial question and response
p.question = TopicQuestion.title  # replace with your topic question variable
p.initial_response = TopicQuestion.val  # replace with your topic question variable

# Initialize tracking variables
p.max_followups = 10  # replace with number of maximum desired follwups for one question
p.current_followup = 1
p.total_followups_shown = 0

# Create arrays to store all followup questions and responses
p.followup_questions = []
p.followup_responses = []

# Initialize thread ID variable
p.thread_id = None
</exec>
```

Next, set up the loop structure that will handle multiple followups. This includes the loop label and the initial check for maximum followups:

```decipher
# --- START THE FOLLOWUP LOOP ---

<label name="GENERATE_FOLLOWUP" />

# Check if we've reached the maximum number of followups
<exec>
p.continue_followup = p.current_followup <= p.max_followups
</exec>

<goto condition="!p.continue_followup" label="END_FOLLOWUPS" />
```

Now, prepare the API request. For the first followup, we use the initial question and response. For subsequent followups, we use the previous followup question and response:

```decipher
<exec>
if p.current_followup == 1:
    # First followup uses initial question and response
    p.prev_question = p.question
    p.prev_response = p.initial_response
    # First followup doesn't need a thread ID
    p.api_data = '{
        "question": "' + p.prev_question + '",
        "answer": "' + p.prev_response + '",
        "surveyName": "<Your Survey Name>",  # optional
        "surveyDescription": "<Description of your survey>",  # optional
        "questionContext": "<What you want to learn from the respondent>",  # optional
        "guidanceBehavior": "Succinct"  # optional, defaults to "Succinct"
    }'
else:
    # Subsequent followups use the previous followup question and response
    p.prev_question = p.followup_questions[p.current_followup - 2]  # Arrays are 0-indexed
    p.prev_response = p.followup_responses[p.current_followup - 2]
    # Include thread ID for followups after the first one
    p.api_data = '{
        "question": "' + p.prev_question + '",
        "answer": "' + p.prev_response + '",
        "surveyName": "<Your Survey Name>",  # optional
        "surveyDescription": "<Description of your survey>",  # optional
        "questionContext": "<What you want to learn from the respondent>",  # optional
        "guidanceBehavior": "Succinct",  # optional, defaults to "Succinct"
        "threadId": "' + p.thread_id + '"  # required for followups after the first one
    }'
</exec>
```

Make the API call to get the followup question:

```decipher
<logic
    label="followup_request"
    api:data="p.api_data"
    api:headers="p.api_headers"
    api:method="POST"
    api:url="https://surveys.getaftercare.com/api/v1/followups"
    sst="0"
    uses="api.1"
/>
```

Process the API response and check if we should continue with followups:

```decipher
<exec>
# Check if the API call was successful
if followup_request.status == 200:
    # Extract the followup question from the response
    p.current_followup_text = followup_request.r["followupQuestion"]

    # For the first followup, store the thread ID for subsequent followups
    if p.current_followup == 1:
        p.thread_id = followup_request.r["threadId"]
else:
    # Use a fallback question if the API call fails
    p.current_followup_text = ""

# Check if the followup text is blank, which means we should stop
p.is_blank_followup = p.current_followup_text.strip() == ""

# Store the current followup text in a variable that matches the current followup number
set("FOLLOWUP_TEXT_" + str(p.current_followup), p.current_followup_text)
</exec>

# Skip to the end if we got a blank followup
<goto condition="p.is_blank_followup" label="END_FOLLOWUPS" />
```

Display the followup question to the respondent and get their response:

```decipher
<textarea
    label="FollowupQuestion_${p.current_followup}"
    height="10"
    optional="1"
    width="50"
>
    <title>${p.current_followup_text}</title>
</textarea>

<suspend />

<exec>
# Get the response
p.current_response = eval("FollowupQuestion_" + str(p.current_followup) + ".unsafe_val")

# Check if response is blank
p.is_blank_response = p.current_response.strip() == ""

# Store the followup question and response in our arrays
p.followup_questions.append(p.current_followup_text)
p.followup_responses.append(p.current_response)

# Increment the followup counter and total followups shown
p.total_followups_shown = p.current_followup
p.current_followup += 1

# Store the response in a variable
set("FOLLOWUP_RESPONSE_" + str(p.total_followups_shown), p.current_response)
</exec>
```

Check if we should continue with more followups:

```decipher
# If the response was blank, end the followups
<goto condition="p.is_blank_response" label="END_FOLLOWUPS" />

# Otherwise, continue with the next followup
<goto label="GENERATE_FOLLOWUP" />
```

Finally, set up the end of the followup section and store all responses for reporting:

```decipher
# --- END OF FOLLOWUPS ---

<label name="END_FOLLOWUPS" />

# Store the total number of followups shown
<exec>TOTAL_FOLLOWUPS.val = p.total_followups_shown</exec>

<text
    label="TOTAL_FOLLOWUPS"
    optional="0"
    size="5"
    where="execute,survey,report"
>
    <title>Total number of followups shown</title>
</text>

<exec>
# Store responses in their respective variables
for i in range(p.total_followups_shown):
    set("FOLLOWUP_RESPONSE_" + str(i + 1), p.followup_responses[i])
</exec>
```

## Data Quality Evaluation

To evaluate the quality of responses using Aftercare's Data Quality API, follow these steps:

First, initialize the API request data in an `<exec>` block. This sets up the headers and prepares the request body:

```decipher
<exec>
# Set up API headers with your Aftercare API key
p.api_headers = {
    "X-Aftercare-Key": "<AFTERCARE API KEY>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Get the questions and responses from your survey. You can evaluate multiple answers from the respondent at once
p.survey_entries = []
p.survey_entries.append({
    "question": TopicQuestion1.title,  # The question that was asked to the respondent
    "answer": TopicQuestion1.val,      # The answer to the question provided by the respondent
    "questionIdentifier": "q1",        # Optional unique identifier for the question
})
p.survey_entries.append({
    "question": TopicQuestion2.title,
    "answer": TopicQuestion2.val,
    "questionIdentifier": "q2",
})

# Prepare the API request body
p.api_data = '{
    "surveyName": "<Your Survey Name>",  # The name of the survey as it will appear in the Aftercare platform
    "surveyDescription": "<Description of your survey>",  # Description of the survey purpose and background
    "surveyIdentifier": "survey_123",  # Optional unique identifier for the survey
    "responseIdentifier": "resp_123",  # Optional unique identifier for a respondent's entire response
    "surveyEntries": [
        {
            "question": "' + p.survey_entries[0]["question"] + '",
            "answer": "' + p.survey_entries[0]["answer"] + '",
            "questionIdentifier": "' + p.survey_entries[0]["questionIdentifier"] + '",
        },
        {
            "question": "' + p.survey_entries[1]["question"] + '",
            "answer": "' + p.survey_entries[1]["answer"] + '",
            "questionIdentifier": "' + p.survey_entries[1]["questionIdentifier"] + '",
        }
    ]
}'
</exec>
```

Next, make the API request using the `<logic>` block. This sends the request to Aftercare's Data Quality API and waits for the response:

```decipher
<logic
    label="quality_request"
    api:data="p.api_data"
    api:headers="p.api_headers"
    api:method="POST"
    api:url="https://surveys.getaftercare.com/api/v1/data-quality/evaluate"
    sst="0"
    uses="api.1"
/>
```

After receiving the response, process it in another `<exec>` block. This handles both successful responses and errors:

```decipher
<exec>
# Check if the API call was successful
if quality_request.status == 200:
    # Extract the overall quality metrics
    p.has_issues = quality_request.r["hasIssues"]  # Whether any issues were detected
    p.num_issues = quality_request.r["numIssues"]  # Number of quality issues detected across all entries
    p.quality_score = quality_request.r["qualityScore"]  # Overall quality score (0-100)

    # Process individual evaluations
    p.evaluations = quality_request.r["evaluations"]
    for i, evaluation in enumerate(p.evaluations):
        # Each evaluation contains:
        # - surveyEntry: The original question and answer
        # - numIssues: Number of issues detected for this entry
        # - qualityScore: Quality score for this entry (0-100)
        # - qualityIssueChecks: Detailed quality checks
        # - hasIssues: Whether any issues were detected

        # Store the quality score for this entry
        set("QUALITY_SCORE_" + str(i + 1), evaluation["qualityScore"])

        # Store the number of issues for this entry
        set("NUM_ISSUES_" + str(i + 1), evaluation["numIssues"])

        # Store whether issues were detected
        set("HAS_ISSUES_" + str(i + 1), evaluation["hasIssues"])
</exec>
```

You can then either:

1. Store these values in your survey data for analysis
2. Access the Aftercare platform to view and download the quality evaluations

## Best Practices

1. **API Key Security**: Store your API key in a secure location and never expose it in client-side code.
2. **Error Handling**: Always implement fallback questions in case the API call fails.

## Troubleshooting

- If you're not receiving followup questions, check your API key and network connectivity.
- For blank responses, verify that your question and response variables are correctly named.
