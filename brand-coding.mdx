## Introduction

<Tip>Looking for the [API reference](/api-reference/coding/create)?</Tip>

Extract brand names from survey responses into a flat list. 

## Best Practices

There are a few tricks to get the best results out of brand coding. 

- add brands in the  <Tooltip tip={brandContextDef}>`brandContext`</Tooltip> to seed the list of brands. This does not need to be an exhaustive list, but a few brands will help the model to understand the context.
- add an industry description to the <Tooltip tip={brandContextDef}>`brandContext`</Tooltip> to help the model understand the context.
