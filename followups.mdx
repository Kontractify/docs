## Introduction

<Tip>Looking for the [API reference](/api-reference/followups/create)?</Tip>

Aftercare AI uses a few steps to generate your followup questions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Survey Context">
    Provide context about the survey,{" "}
    <Tooltip tip={topicQuestionDef}>`topic question`</Tooltip>, and response
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evaluate">
    Determine the <Tooltip tip={relevanceDef}>`relevance`</Tooltip> and{" "}
    <Tooltip tip={completenessDef}>`completeness`</Tooltip> of the survey.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate">
    Create the followup question using{" "}
    <Tooltip tip={guidanceDef}>`guidance`</Tooltip>.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Survey Context

> Garbage in, garbage out
>
> \- a wise man

The quality of followup question that Aftercare AI generates is dependent on the quality of context given to Aftercare about the survey.
While many fields are optional, try to provide as many as you can.

<Tip>
  Question context is especially helpful for followup generation. Telling the AI
  what you are trying to learn from the question helps Aftercare reason about
  the right line of questioning.
</Tip>

See the followup generation [API reference](/api-reference/followups/create) for the most up to date params.

### Evaluation

Aftercare will evaluate the survey, topic question, and response and provide two scores:

- `completeness`: {completenessDef}. Responses high in completeness answer the topic question well, with detail.
- `relevance`: {relevanceDef}. Responses low in relevance are usually no-answer, troll answers, or just completely unrelated answers.

These scores are used in the next section, [generation](/followups#generation)

### Generation

Determining when to stop asking a followup question is a fairly nuanced problem that depends on the situation. Aftercare provides some common followup behaviors to choose from, called `guidance behavior`. Alternatively you can determine the followup behavior on your own using the `completeness` and `relevance` scores.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Succinct (default)" icon="pencil">
    The AI will not generate a follow-up question if the response is irrelevant
    or complete. This is the default behavior.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Redirection" icon="person-walking-arrow-loop-left">
    The AI will return a follow-up question that redirects the user to answering
    the top-level question if it is irrelevant and incomplete.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verbose" icon="comment-dots">
    The AI will return a follow-up question regardless of the relevance or
    completeness of the response.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Generation Language

You can customize the language used by the AI to generate followups with the `responseLanguage` parameter. By default, Aftercare will generate a followup in the language it determines best matches the respondent's answer.

Set response language to `match_response_language` to automatically set the language of the generated follow up question to the language of the respondent's answer.

<Tip>
  Use the Verbose behavior, completeness score, and relevance score to implement
  your own followup behavior.
