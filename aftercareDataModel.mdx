## Introduction

When using our APIs, Aftercare can store your survey data to create our own internal model of the survey.

This allows us to give you a rich set of analytics over your survey responses within the Aftercare platform, including automatic coding and summarization.

## How it works

To allow Aftercare to model your survey data, you'll need to provide a few piece of information that uniquely identify each survey object, what we call `identifiers`:

- `surveyIdentifier`: A string that uniquely identifies the survey across your organization. (e.g. "Survey_01")

- `questionIdentifier`: A string that uniquely identifies a question for a particular survey. (e.g. "Q1")

- `responseIdentifier`: A string that uniquely identifies one respondent's entire response to a survey. This means that if a respondent answers multiple questions within the same survey, they should all have the same `responseIdentifier`. (e.g. "7a54b8da-f65d-4946-9c9a-f202e0cc29c8")

Not all API endpoints require all three identifiers to model your survey data, but you can see the requirements for each endpoint in the API reference.

<Tip>
  Aftercare only models your survey data if you provide the required identifiers
  for the particular API call. So don't worry! If you don't want Aftercare to
  model your survey data, you don't need to provide these identifiers and you
  can still use the API as normal.
</Tip>

Note: On the difference between `surveyIdentifier` and `surveyName`:

- `surveyIdentifier`: A string that uniquely identifies the survey across your
  organization. Think of it as you would any ID for an object in a database.
  (e.g. "Survey_01")
- `surveyName`: The name of the survey as it will appear in the Aftercare platform
  for tracking usage or analytics. You want it to be easy to understand so you
  can easily tell surveys apart from each other. (e.g. "Brand Tracking XYZ")

## Data Model

This is how the data is modeled in Aftercare:

![Data Model](/images/survey_data_model.png)

- `Survey`: An object containing all the information about one survey. Groups together questions and responses.

- `Question`: An object uniquely identifying one question in a survey.

- `Response`: An object grouping together all the response elements for one respondent's response to a survey.

- `ResponseElement`: One question/answer pair from a respondent's response to a survey.

## Analytics

### Coding:

We use AI to automatically code all your responses. Let us handle generating the code frame or you can provide one yourself!

We categorize and subcategorize to generate a theme hierarchy for your responses. We can perform the coding in real-time as responses come in or at the end when all the responses have been completed.
